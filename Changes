0.01	2003-08-09 22:10:00 GMT 
	- Basic idea for inplace upgrade to Tie::SortHash


0.02	2003-08-09 23:47:00 GMT
	- Removed eval string requirement while maintaining compatability


0.03	2003-09-05 17:38:00 GMT
	- Backwards compatability dropped and Tie::SortedHash is born


0.04	2003-09-08 23:59:00 GMT
	- Made to be compatible >= 5.005_03
	- Added forcesort method
	- Added README, POD, Changes, and tests


0.05	2003-09-09 23:59:00 GMT
	- Made default optimization to only resort when change detected
	- Added optimization levels
		default	- only regenerate order when change detected
		none	- regenerate order everytime FIRSTKEY is called
		keys	- STORE: don't set CHANGED flag unless new key
		values	- STORE: don't set CHANGED flag if value stays the same
	- Added dispatch table for STORE depending on optimization level
	- Created set mutator method for altering options after tie()
	- Updated README, POD, and tests

		DELETE returns without performing delete if key is non-existant
		BEGIN { *NEXTKEY = \&_FetchKey };
	- Changed Opt_Level => # to Optimization => string
	- Change set mutator method to two mutators
		Sort_Routine
		Optimization
